I am a thoughtful decision maker with excellent organizational and interpersonal skills, the ability to remain calm and focused during difficult situations, and a willingness to go the extra mile to accomplish objectives. I am adept at working with diverse teams as well as individually to implement projects. 

I am excited to continue cultivating my technical knowledge and to contribute clean intuitive code toward advancements that improve our everyday lives.
